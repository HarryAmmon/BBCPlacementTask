# Trainee (Web) BBC News JS Coding Test
## Creating an articles ranker
This is my attempt at the BBC News JS Coding Test.

I have used a Node server to deal with the GET and POST requests.

To run the Node server, first ensure Node is downloaded on your computer. A tutorial on how to do this can be found [here](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows).

Once Node is installed, using the command line, change to the directory that this repository is saved in.

Use the command 'node server.js' to start the server. If this has been successful, 'Server listening on port 3000' should be output to the terminal.

To access the website, open index.html in your web browser.
